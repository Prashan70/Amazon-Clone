# Amazon-Clone
This project is a static clone of the Amazon home page, built using HTML and CSS. It features a styled header with a search bar, product display sections, organized category listings, and a footer with additional links.  This project helps improve HTML and CSS skills by replicating the layout and design of a real-world e-commerce homepage.
